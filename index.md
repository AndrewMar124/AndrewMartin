### Bio

I am a current senior undergraduate student at Christopher Newport University working on a Bachelor's degree in cyber security with a minor in information systems. I currently work for YCSD as a substitute teacher with the hope of inspiring the next generation to learn about the technology that is all around them, and more importantly to enjoy learning. On top of this I teach drum lessons and have learned a lot about how to teach in general. I am also involved with the CNU cybersecurity club, participating in events and challenges such as cyber forge and local and online CTFs.

I beleive the educatioin of technology is critical, and more importantly bringing awareness of the benifits and dangers of tech, both new and old.

In my spare time I listen to and create music, serve in my community, enjoy fellowship with my friends, and occasionally play the Nintendo Wii.

One of my goals is to stay up to date in the world of computer security while constantly learning and adding new security tools and techniques to my toolbox. I have found many ways to do this on top of Cyber classes through HTB, cyber newsletters, and personal projects and research. The current personal research I have been focused on is *web security*; with my main focus on techniques to defend servers from DOS and code injection, as well as implement a functional and secure user authentication portal. 

 My main goal is to increase the overall awareness of cyber security on my campus and wherever I go after my time at CNU. While I know that I do not know everything, I do know that my foundational knowlege of technology and my teachability have been the cornerstone of my passion for learning and securing systems thus far.

 I hold a CC certification from ISC2 and am currenty working on earning a SEC+ certification from CompTIA this Winter.
